## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Kaggle Boston Airbnb Open Data to better understand:

1. What's the difference between superhost and regular host?
   1) Do super hosts respond faster than the regular host? 
   2) Which amenities are more likely to be provided by the superhost vs. the regular host?
   3) Do the superhosts' review score is higher than the none superhost?
2. Is there any bias between the house or other house tpye among the Amenity type ?
3. What's the top 10 expensive neighbourhood?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are one notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict price.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
